Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method.",

To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu (Windows) or the",

With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, such as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table sources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the primary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more accurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations.

The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted.",

When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures).",

You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging.

To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.",
